WORK IN PROGRESS!  The APIs provided by this gem are not yet stable.

Using CoffeeScript with Rails 3 and Barista?  This gem will eventually
allow you to run CommonJS-style unit tests from the command line.  For a
description of the CommonJS assertion API, see
http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Unit_Testing/1.0#Test.

Place your tests in either +test/coffeescripts+ or +spec/coffeescripts+,
and run:

    rake barista:test
